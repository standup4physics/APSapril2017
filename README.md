# APSapril2017
===============

The purpose of this repository is to organize for the APS April Meeting in Washington, DC on Jan 28-31, 2017

We want to come together to Stand Up for Science especially in our field of Physics.

Join us by looking through the list of to-dos and doing a thing.

Let's make this happen!
